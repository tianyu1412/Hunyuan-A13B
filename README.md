## Use with transformers

Our model defaults to using slow-thinking reasoning, and there are two ways to disable CoT reasoning. 
1. Pass "enable_thinking=False" when calling apply_chat_template.
2. Adding "/no_think" before the prompt will force the model not to use perform CoT reasoning. Similarly, adding "/think" before the prompt will force the model to perform CoT reasoning.

The following code snippet shows how to use the transformers library to load and apply the model. It also demonstrates how to enable and disable the reasoning mode , and how to parse the reasoning process along with the final output.



```python
from transformers import AutoModelForCausalLM, AutoTokenizer
import os
import re

model_name_or_path = os.environ['MODEL_PATH']
# model_name_or_path = "tencent/Hunyuan-A13B-Instruct"

tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(model_name_or_path, trust_remote_code=True)
model = AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained(model_name_or_path, device_map="auto",trust_remote_code=True)  # You may want to use bfloat16 and/or move to GPU here
messages = [
    {"role": "user", "content": "Write a short summary of the benefits of regular exercise"},
]
tokenized_chat = tokenizer.apply_chat_template(messages, tokenize=True, return_tensors="pt",
                                                enable_thinking=True # Toggle thinking mode (default: True)
                                                )
                                                
outputs = model.generate(tokenized_chat.to(model.device), max_new_tokens=4096)

output_text = tokenizer.decode(outputs[0])

think_pattern = r'<think>(.*?)</think>'
think_matches = re.findall(think_pattern, output_text, re.DOTALL)

answer_pattern = r'<answer>(.*?)</answer>'
answer_matches = re.findall(answer_pattern, output_text, re.DOTALL)

think_content = [match.strip() for match in think_matches][0]
answer_content = [match.strip() for match in answer_matches][0]
print(f"thinking_content:{think_content}\n\n")
print(f"answer_content:{answer_content}\n\n")
```



## Training Quick Start
Hunyuan-A13B provides processes related to model training. Please refer to [Training](train/README.md) for model training purposes.


## Quantization Compression
We used our own `AngleSlim` compression tool to produce FP8 and INT4 quantization models. `AngleSlim` compression tool is expected to be open source in early July, which will support one-click quantization and compression of large models, please look forward to it, and you can download our quantization models directly for deployment testing now.

### FP8 Quantization
We use FP8-static quantization, FP8 quantization adopts 8-bit floating point format, through a small amount of calibration data (without training) to pre-determine the quantization scale, the model weights and activation values will be converted to FP8 format, to improve the inference efficiency and reduce the deployment threshold. We you can use AngleSlim quantization, you can also directly download our quantization completed open source model to use [Hunyuan-A13B-Instruct-FP8](https://huggingface.co/tencent/Hunyuan-A13B-Instruct-FP8).

#### FP8 Benchmark
This subsection describes the Benchmark metrics for the Hunyuan-80B-A13B-Instruct-FP8 quantitative model.

|   DROP    |         91.1          |           91.1            |

### Int4 Quantization
We use the GPTQ algorithm to achieve W4A16 quantization, which processes the model weights layer by layer, uses a small amount of calibration data to minimize the reconfiguration error of the quantized weights, and adjusts the weights layer by layer by the optimization process of approximating the Hessian inverse matrix. The process eliminates the need to retrain the model and requires only a small amount of calibration data to quantize the weights, improving inference efficiency and lowering the deployment threshold. You can use `AngleSlim` quantization, you can also directly download our quantization completed open source model to use [Hunyuan-A13B-Instruct-Int4](https://huggingface.co/tencent/Hunyuan-A13B-Instruct-GPTQ-Int4).
